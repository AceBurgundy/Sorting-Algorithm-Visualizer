# 🌳 JAVAFx BinaryTree Visualizer

**JAVAFx BinaryTree Visualizer** is a JavaFX desktop application designed to visually demonstrate the inner workings of popular sorting algorithms. It animates how data is sorted in real time, making it an excellent educational tool for students, teachers, and self-learners.

> 🔍 This project is open-source and licensed under the **GNU GPL v3** to encourage collaboration, modification, and learning.

## 🎯 Purpose

This tool bridges the gap between textbook theory and visual intuition, allowing users to observe how sorting algorithms operate step-by-step. It’s ideal for anyone wanting to better understand the behavior and logic of sorting methods.

## ✨ Features

* 📊 **Sorting Algorithm Visualizations**
  See how each algorithm rearranges the data step-by-step.

* 🎮 **Interactive Controls**
  Shuffle data, adjust speed, or reset to try different experiments.

* 💻 **Clean JavaFX GUI**
  A responsive and intuitive interface using JavaFX for smooth animations.

* 🧪 **Algorithms Included**:

  * Bubble Sort
  * Merge Sort
  * Quick Sort
  * Radix Sort
  * Shell Sort
  * Heap Sort

## 🖥️ Built With

* **Java 11+**
* **JavaFX**
* Optional: Scene Builder for GUI design

## 📦 Installation

### ✅ Option 1: Download Executable

You can download and run the compiled application directly:

🔗 [Download Sorting Algorithms.exe](https://github.com/AceBurgundy/JAVAFx-Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer/raw/main/Sorting%20Algorithms.exe)

No setup required—just download and launch!

### 🛠️ Option 2: Build from Source

#### Requirements

* Java JDK 11 or higher
* JavaFX SDK
* Java-compatible IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)

#### Setup Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AceBurgundy/JAVAFx-Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer.git
cd JAVAFx-Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer

# Open the project in your IDE and make sure JavaFX is configured
# Run the main class (usually Main.java)
```

## 📸 Screenshots *(Optional)*

*Consider adding screenshots like:*

* Algorithm selection screen
* Sorting in progress (animations)
* Speed control and other UI features

## 🛠️ Future Plans

* 🔢 Add Binary Tree Visualizations (insert, delete, traverse)
* 👣 Step-by-step execution mode
* 📈 Time complexity charts per algorithm
* 🌐 Convert to a web-based version for browser access
