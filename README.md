## 🎯 Purpose

This tool bridges the gap between textbook theory and visual intuition, allowing users to observe how sorting algorithms operate step-by-step. It’s ideal for anyone wanting to better understand the behavior and logic of sorting methods.

## ✨ Features

* 📊 **Sorting Algorithm Visualizations**
  See how each algorithm rearranges the data step-by-step.

* 🎮 **Interactive Controls**
  Shuffle data, adjust speed, or reset to try different experiments.

* 💻 **Clean JavaFX GUI**
  A responsive and intuitive interface using JavaFX for smooth animations.

* 🧪 **Algorithms Included**:

  * Bubble Sort
  * Merge Sort
  * Quick Sort
  * Radix Sort
  * Shell Sort
  * Heap Sort

## 🖥️ Built With

* **Java 11+**
* **JavaFX**
* Optional: Scene Builder for GUI design

## 📦 Installation
